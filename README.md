# -iamhmk-Data-Provenance-Assurance-for-Cloud-Storage-using-Blockchain
To Develop and implement a Data Provenance Mechanism for cloud using Blockchain and IPFS Protocol. We develop an AWS S3 storage application to demonstrate the process. The storage application records the operations of the user like add, delete, edit for user-specified files. These log records are stored in the IPFS network, which gives the Hash. These hashes of provenance data are then stored in Ethereum blockchain using consensus networks as a transaction. We also validate the mechanism if an attempt is made to modify a provenance data record.
